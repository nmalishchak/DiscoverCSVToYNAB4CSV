# DiscoverCSVToYNAB4CSV
A quick command-line/drag-and-drop utilty I threw together to convert CSV Activity Statements from Discover to the CSV format supported by You Need a Budget 4 (YNAB4). Discover dropped support for QFX and QIF in October 2022, so their CSV is now the only import option for YNAB 4.
